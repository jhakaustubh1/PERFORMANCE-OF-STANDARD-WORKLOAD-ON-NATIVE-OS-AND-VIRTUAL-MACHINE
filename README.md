# PERFORMANCE-OF-STANDARD-WORKLOAD-ON-NATIVE-OS-AND-VIRTUAL-MACHINE
Virtualization empowers establishment and running of various virtual machines on a similar
PC framework. Operating System that discusses straightforwardly with hardware
equipment is known as the host operating framework though virtual working system have
every one of the highlights of a genuine operating system, however they keep running
inside the host operating system.
The performance of a virtual machine on similar PC framework equipment relies upon the
presentation of the host OS.
We first perform various different benchmarks and performance tests and provide a survey
of performance studies, comparing and analysing different benchmark results of various
tasks like start-up(boot-up),video editing, video conferencing and many more. We run
these tests on different virtual machines namely,
1. Windows 10.
2. Ubuntu 18.04.
3. Kali Linux .
4. Fedora
